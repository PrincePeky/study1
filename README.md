ABOUT MY PROJECT:
      My website on project0 is a company that deals on Fruits and also delivery of any kind or type
 of fruits worldwide. My website contains HTML,CSS and SCSS properties. It contains 4 .html
 pages with extra links that can be found in the linked pages and it is easy to navigate from one
 page to another just by following the hyperlinks contructed in them. Customers can easily sign
up to have private accounts that they can use to track their orders and make future purchases and
the form tag was used to do that. I used different html with css selectors and properties just like
**image properties
**list elements
**form tag
**table tags and also table styling
**stylesheets for headings and paragraph tags
**size attributes for styling
**I also included border tags
Another significant property i used in the website is the div span property that also added
some effects to the styling with also the .name attribute.
I also included the Links1.html element which can allow any user to navigate from one
section of the body to nother section easily and comfortably without the screen or device
being used affecting the process or view.
Some other important features i included in the website is the Hover feature which changes
the color and selection of the button element. I also used the Before and Selection properties
which can be found in the homepage.html page.
I also used a very important element which is the responsive design element that controls
the media print control for downloads.
I also used boostrap 4 for my website and also the columns layout design like the
<div class= "container"> and also the alert features for my bootstrap.
and finally i included the variables.scss property and also one nesting feature with finally
the inheritance.css feature which also involves styling.
Generally, ,y website explains all about fruits and also things we should know as to why
they are important for our body. My website contains a shopping features, where customers
can also place orders online and get it delivered anywhere and in time. There is also a
possibility to rate us on google and drop feedbacks or complaints.
